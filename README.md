# Light Trackers
This repo is dedicated for 3 individual implementations of light trackers using servo motor, stepper motor and a DC motor. An ambient light sensor fixed on top of the each motor's arm is used to track a flash light source. Refer to [schematics](/schematics) and [report files](/docs) for reference.
